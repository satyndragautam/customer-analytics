# ðŸ“Š Customer Analytics

I began this project while awaiting the completion of paperwork for my US work permit alongside enjoying becoming a father. 
I wanted to use this time to expand my skills and explore a new area of expertise. This project was all about improving customer 
experience, something I learned was vital for businesses. During this program, I developed a deep understanding into the basics 
of customer experience and learned how to use different methods such as descriptive analytics, predictive analytics, prescriptive 
analytics to tackle real-world business challenges and make sense of raw data to improve customer experience efficiently.

Additionally, this project provided detailed information on how companies like Amazon, Google, and Starbucks use analytics 
to make informed decisions. This course helped me understand the history and best practices of customer analytics and how 
to apply them in real-world scenarios. Overall, this project was aimed to gain introductory 
knowledge into customer analytics and understand the basics of it
